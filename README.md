## Overview

WaveML-JAX is a **reference implementation** of *Error Rectification by Alignment (ERA)*, a governance mechanism for wave-native learning systems.

ERA enforces physically meaningful invariants on internal model states—**amplitude, energy, and phase**—to ensure bounded trajectories and graceful degradation under noise, drift, and long-horizon propagation.

This repository provides a **canonical, minimal, and correct** implementation intended for research, evaluation, and extension.

---

## Core Idea

Conventional machine learning systems attempt to achieve robustness indirectly through preprocessing, regularization, or loss shaping.

ERA takes a different approach:

> **Robustness is governed, not optimized.**

ERA constrains *how internal states may evolve*, independently of task objectives, by enforcing invariant-preserving rectification at every computational step.

## What This Repository Is

✅ A reference implementation of ERA  
✅ Wave-native state representations (amplitude + phase)  
✅ Deterministic, reproducible JAX code  
✅ Synthetic and academic benchmarks  
✅ Baseline comparisons for stability and robustness  

---

## What This Repository Is NOT

❌ A production-ready system  
❌ A domain-calibrated solution  
❌ A collection of tuned hyperparameters  
❌ A deployment playbook  

Domain-specific calibration, operating envelopes, and production integrations are intentionally **out of scope**.

## Error Rectification by Alignment (ERA)

ERA enforces the following invariants at every step:

1. **Amplitude non-negativity**
2. **Amplitude bounds (element-wise)**
3. **Total energy bounds (global)**
4. **Phase wrapping to \([-π, π]\)**
5. **Phase gating where amplitude vanishes**

Rather than suppressing or filtering states, ERA **realigns** them to the nearest admissible configuration while preserving information content.

---

## Design Principles

- **Wave-native**: Phase is preserved end-to-end
- **Governed dynamics**: Invalid states cannot arise
- **Differentiable**: Fully compatible with gradient-based learning
- **Architecture-agnostic**: Applicable to recurrent, convolutional, and hybrid systems
- **Deterministic**: Reproducible by design

---

## Intended Use

WaveML-JAX is intended for:

- Research into robustness and stability
- Evaluation of wave-native representations
- Benchmarking against classical baselines
- Educational and exploratory use

It is **not** intended as a drop-in production system.
